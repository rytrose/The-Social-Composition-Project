# The-Social-Composition-Project
by Ryan Rose (c) June, 2016

A Facebook-generated music composition using Facebook's Graph API (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api) and the W3C Web Audio API (https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/)

This project seeks to interpret the humanity exhibited through social media into music, by procedurally generating a unique composition based upon a Facebook post's reactions. Each reaction has a distinct melodic phrase, which floats over an oscillating drone. A disproportionate amount of 'LIKE's relative to the other reactions led me to compose special phrases for when a sequence of uninterrupted 'LIKE's is read.
