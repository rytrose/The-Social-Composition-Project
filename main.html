 *  The Social Composition Project
 *    by Ryan Rose
 *   (c) June, 2016
 *
 *  This project seeks to interpret the humanity exhibited through social media into music,
 *  by procedurally generating a unique composition based upon a Facebook post's reactions.
 *  Each reaction has a distinct melodic phrase, which floats over an oscillating drone.
 *  A disproprtionate amount of 'LIKE's relative to the other reactions led me to compose special
 *  phrases for when a sequence of uninterrupted 'LIKE's is read.
